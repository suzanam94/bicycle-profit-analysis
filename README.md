# bicycle-profit-analysis

Project Overview
1. Data Preprocessing:

- Converted date columns to datetime format and extracted year and month for trend analysis.
- Calculated additional metrics, including total sales, total cost, and profit.
- Identified and addressed missing or irrelevant data, such as excluding Germany due to limited transactions.
  
2.Key Analyses:

-Yearly Trends: Visualized total sales and profit trends (2005-2008), highlighting a decline in 2008.
-Regional Insights: Focused on United States and France for profitability analysis in 2007-2008, as Germany data was limited.
-Monthly Comparisons: Examined monthly profit trends for 2007 and 2008 across regions.

3. Findings:

- Both sales and profits declined significantly in 2008.
- The United States remained the most profitable region, with France contributing less but showing meaningful trends.

4. Visualizations:

- Line plots for yearly sales and profit trends.
- Bar charts for regional profitability.
- Pivot tables and comparisons of monthly profits across regions.
